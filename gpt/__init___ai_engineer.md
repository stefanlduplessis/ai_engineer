gpt - A package for integrating with OpenAI's models.

This package provides an interface to interact with various AI models,
specifically tailored for project management tasks in Python.

from .openai_engineer import OpenAIEngineer

__all__ = ["OpenAIEngineer"]

# You can add any additional module imports here as needed.
# Ensure to follow the proper Python package structure for better organization.
```

### Improvements Made:
- Added a module-level docstring to describe the purpose of the package.
- Imported `OpenAIEngineer` in the `__init__.py` to make it directly accessible when the package is imported.
- Defined `__all__` to specify which classes or functions should be available for import when using `from gpt import *`. This promotes a cleaner namespace and better encapsulation practices.
